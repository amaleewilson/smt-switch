- GMP setup for the setup script 
- catch out of memory errors


misc API stuff that seems useful:

void yices_free_string(char *s)
Frees a string s returned by Yices.
Several API functions build and return a character string that is allocated by Yices. To avoid memory leaks, this string must be freed when it is no longer used by calling this function.
